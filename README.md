# Fake-News-Detection: Project Overview
- In this data science project idea, we will use Python to build a model that can accurately detect whether a piece of news is real or fake.
- We've build TfidfVectorizer and used different classifier to classify between "Real" and "Fake" news.
- In this project, for optimization we've used __3__ different machine learning model.
- Using different classifiers, we've reached to optimal solution.
